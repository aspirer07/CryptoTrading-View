# CryptoTrading-View
This is a Crypto Trading website which enables a user to see the lastest trends in the market using the line grapghs which are being accessed using CoinGecko API. The chart shows 1 day graph, 30 days graph and 90 days graph.  
For backend I have used Firebase which shows the user credentials and shows the watchlist which indicates which crypto currency the user is watching out.
The front end is being designed using reactJS.
The carousel shows the top 10 trending crypto currencies for the past 24hrs.
